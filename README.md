## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thekalvpsia/optiroute.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd optiroute
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up your API keys:
   - Frontend API Key: Open `index.html`, locate the Google Maps `<script>` tag, and replace the existing API key (the value between `key=` and `&libraries=places`) with your own. **If you try running this with my key, it wonâ€™t work. Nice try.**
   - Backend API Key: Create a `.env` file from the example template:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
     Then, add your BACKEND_API_KEY inside the `.env` file.
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. Open your browser and go to:
